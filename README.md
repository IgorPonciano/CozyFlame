A project dedicated to development and experimentation with a stylized 3D prompt

I'll be using this repository to store and manage an unity project, where I aim to test and experiment learning some new cool stuff.

Actually there is no license file included to this project cause I really don't think it will be needed for now. If for any reason you found this repository and is interested in contributing to it in any way, feel free to ask me to add the appropriate license ^^.
